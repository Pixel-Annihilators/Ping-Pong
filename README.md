# PING PONG

Classic Ping Pong but a little different.

In classic ping pong the ball moves in a random direction after you hit it.
But in this game it moves like how it would if you hit a ball approaching you
in real life. Ball direction and speed is determined by stick movement direction
and speed. You earn points by hitting the ball back, and lose by missing.

## Future ideas
1. Local multiplayer
